collect_reduce.h
Major changes

In quicksort, transpose, bucket_sort, sample_sort
Fixed sort since it was core dumping due to double free, but no longer supports non-relocatable types, need to figure out a compromise that is fast and correct

io.h
by default it now does not null terminate chars_from_file 
updated so can separatedly compile

file_map.h
added inline to swap so can multiply compile

primitives.h
got rid of const in map_tokens so function can modify the input string in place
fixed type of out to && in pack_into

sequence.h
passing granularity in from_function
added clear_uninitialized
added granularity in some parallel_fors
added special case for is_small in copy constructor

utilities.h
put in copy_memory for now until properly fixed 

alloc.h
added p_alloc, p_free (just alloc and free)

posix/file_map_impl_posix.h
fixed assert around fstat

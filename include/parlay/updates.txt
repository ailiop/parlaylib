collect_reduce.h
Major changes

In quicksort, transpose, bucket_sort, sample_sort
Fixed sort since it was core dumping due to double free, but no longer supports non-relocatable types, need to figure out a compromise that is fast and correct
all changes marked as "tmpfix in comments".

io.h
by default it now does not null terminate chars_from_file 
updated so can separately compile

file_map.h
added inline to swap so can separately compile

primitives.h
got rid of const in map_tokens so function can modify the input string in place
fixed type of out to && in pack_into
fixed a bug in map_split_at (missing +1, and n for m)

sequence.h
passing granularity in from_function
added clear_uninitialized
added granularity in some parallel_fors
added special case for is_small in copy constructor

utilities.h
put in copy_memory with include string.h for now until sort is fixed

alloc.h
added p_alloc, p_free (just alloc and free ussing parlay allocator)

posix/file_map_impl_posix.h
fixed assert around fstat


Todo:
better granularity control in parallel_fors in sequence.h
